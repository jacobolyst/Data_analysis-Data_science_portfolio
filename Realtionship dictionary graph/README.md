<h3>Relationship graph of online dictionary</h3> 

Web scraping of Polish dictionary made by Wikipedia with analysis of Polish language and looking for circular (self-loop) definitions of the words. Beyond creating realtionshi graph with the whole headwords from the dictionary, my group found the most popular words in Polish language to describe other words or fraction of the phases of speech, but first of all we cheked the uniqueness of the nodes in the definitions to create crawled graphs of headwords.

This project was realized as a part of course called <i>Analysis of unstructered data</i>.
